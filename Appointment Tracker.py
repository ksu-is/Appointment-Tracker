''' This is a simple vaccine management system using SQLite. 
    It demonstrates the capabilities of SQLite. It is not intended for production environments.
    For example, the changemade variable does not update once the program is started.
    So, if someone left the application open for a long time and made changes later, the data would not be accurate.
